## Induction Motor Simulation

### Objective
To study the torque-speed characteristics of a three-phase induction motor using Simulink.

### Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink

### Description
This project analyzes the performance of an induction motor under different load conditions using simulation.
Key parameters such as speed, torque, and slip are observed and plotted.
